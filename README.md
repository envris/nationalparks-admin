## Access

This repository is public from day one. Avoid inappropriate content, fix it immediately if it occurs. 

Everyone in the Parks Australia product team has admin priveleges here, so you can read/write and grant priveleges to other GitHub accounts. That is an experiment, please use the power responsibly.


## The Repo

Make a top level folder per topic/domain. For example, rdbms/, docs/, jenkins/ etc.

Give top level folders a README.md, plus whatever else you need.


## Tickets

Remember these are public. It's OK for anyone to raise tickets, we will do our best to help out.
